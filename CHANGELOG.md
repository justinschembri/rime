# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.4.3 - unreleased]

### Internal

- Fix broken tests.
- **FROST package refactor** — the `frost` sub-package has been restructured
  into focused, single-responsibility modules:
  - `types.py` — enums (`FrostVersions`, `FrostEndpoints`, `FrostParams`) and
    the `FrostEntityRef` dataclass.
  - `errors.py` — exception hierarchy (`FrostConnectionError`,
    `FrostRequestError`, `FrostNoResultsError`, `FrostWriterError`).
  - `bridges.py` — lookup tables between the SensorThings domain model and the
    FROST wire protocol (navigation-link keys, endpoint paths).
  - `sanitization.py` — URL/param normalisation helpers and OData clause
    builders (`sanitize_get_request`, `sanitize_root_url`, `merge_filter`,
    `merge_order_by`, `rewrite_to_internal`).
  - `get.py` — paginated entity lookups, object lookups, datastream observation
    queries, and navigation-link resolution.
  - `post.py` — raw POST, idempotent entity creation, and observation upload.
  - `helpers.py` — per-type existence checkers and the connectivity probe.
  - `writers.py` — `FrostWriter` class supporting stream and buffered JSON/CSV
    output with atomic file rename.
  - `orchestrators.py` — `initial_setup` for full sensor-config provisioning in
    dependency order.
- Added Google-style docstrings across all FROST modules.
- Added `frost/README.md` describing the package structure, data flow, and
  key design decisions.
- **Fix external requests on paginated queries** (#61) — `frost_entity_lookup_pages`
  now rewrites `@iot.nextLink` URLs to the internal root before following them,
  closing the path by which containerised deployments with a public
  `serviceRootUrl` would leak paginated GET requests outside the container
  network. Navigation links in POST paths were already handled via
  `rewrite_to_internal`; this closes the remaining gap.
- **Remove `frost_data_retrieval.py`** — legacy predecessor to the `frost/`
  package; no longer imported anywhere and superseded by `frost/get.py`.

## [v0.4.2]

### Fixed

- **Improved restart policy** - dead threads do not cause app restarts, but connections
  to restart.

## [v0.4.1]

### Fixed

- **Python Version** - upgraded minimum python version to 3.12 due to typing styles
  are PEP 701 compliant and therefore not compatabile with earlier versions.

## [v0.4.0]

### Added

- **Mount points** → The directories where sensor and application configuration
  files live (`deploy/sensor_configs` and `deploy/application-configs.yml`)
  are now always mounted in `docker-compose` files.
- **Support for external configuration directories** → By specifying the
  environment variables `SENSOR_CONFIG_PATH` and `APPLICATION_CONFIG_FILE` or by
  declaring them in a `.env` file in `/deploy`, you can point to an external
  host location for configuration files. This allows users to have separate git
  worktrees for configuration.

### Changed

- **Sensor config sourcing**: Config loading and generation use overridable
  paths; config generator reads templates and writes generated configs under the
  variable sensor config path.
- **Preflight execution**: Preflight runs at thread start instead of in
  `__init__`, so subclass attributes (e.g. MQTT `topic`) are set and failure
  prevents the connection from starting.
- **MQTT callbacks**: Improved connection and subscription logging/callbacks in
  MQTT sensor application connections.
- **Docker Compose**: Application config mount target aligned (typo fix in
  `docker-compose.app.yml`).

### Removed

- **requirements.txt**: Removed legacy `requirements.txt` in favour of
  `pyproject.toml` / uv for dependency management.

### Internal

- `.gitignore`: Added CSV ignore and cleanup.
- **Preflight checks** for sensor application connections. Subclasses can
  override `_preflight()` to run checks before a connection starts (e.g. TTS
  topic must include tenant ID `@ttn`). Preflight runs when starting the
  pull/transform/push thread; on failure the connection is not started and a
  warning is logged.
- **Date option handling** for FROST data retrieval (#58).
